## Description

With this web app, I hope to respond to a need that I and other users have using the [Boxing & Bubbles](https://christadipaolo.com/) online fitness platform: getting suggestions of workouts from the B&B library based on a list of criteria.

Currently, users need to browse the entire library and open workout videos to fully read what to expect in the workout (as the text preview isn't always completely readable when hovering over the video preview).

This app aims to provide a quick and intelligent way of finding the most suitable workouts based on the user's wishes.

The user will be presented with a form and will be able to select:

- the type of workout: Cardio, Strength, Mobility
- the workout focus: Above the belt, Below the belt, Abs, Full body
- the workout level: Easy, Intermediate, Advanced (optional)
- equipment: Heavyweights, Kettlebell, Resistance band, Jump rope, Boxing bag, Gliders, Chair, Equipment free (optional)
- duration: Short (< 25 min), Average (25-45 min), Long (> 45 min)

The form will then display a list of all workouts found in the B&B librabry matching the criteria.
